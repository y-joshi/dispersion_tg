The Dispersion problem on a Triangular Grid with
a particular set of configurations is introduced in this paper.
We present a five-stage algorithm that can solve the problem
in O(max(Hg , Wg )) time rounds, using only O(log k) bits for
the mobile robots. Our solution provides an optimal solution in
terms of both time and memory complexity for Dispersion on a
given configuration of a triangular grid.
